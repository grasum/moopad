# Config has two sections
# The "actions" section lists actions to take for each path. But see
# the TODO section on stages.
# The "action_templates" section defines actions that can then be
# referred to in the "actions" section. It is optional and can be used
# to avoid defining the same action multiple times for different paths.
# The "action" key defined under a path is matched to the "id" key under
# "action_templates".

# TODO:
#   - Validate config file
#     - Check that all actions under paths with no "run" key defined
#       have a correspondent under "actions"
#     - More action types than just "shell"
#   - Consider TOML instead of YAML. Is it more readable?
